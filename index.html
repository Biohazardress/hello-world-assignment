            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Sarah Contreras. I have been a student at Chaffey since Summer 2017. I am very close to graduating and hope to transfer and get my bachelors. Its been a few semesters since I learned HTML so I plan to reference old assignments in case I need a refresh.</p>
            <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I have a bird named Alex. He always is asking for a "wiwi", or a cashew and throws kisses when I go to work.</li>
                <li>I have a twin who I photobombed in the picture below. We played water polo in high school and are happy to see our brother follow in our footsteps.</li>
                <li>I've been actively crocheting for about a year. My sister and I have been entering in markets and will definitely try to open an etsy or something this year.</li>
